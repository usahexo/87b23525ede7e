#  Saturn Retrograde in Natal Chart EnhancesLuck in Playing!

At the time of writing this article, Saturn is retrograde in the natal chart of many people. The affect of this planetary transit is said to be one of enhanced luck when it comes to playing games of chance!

As an astrologer, I have found that my clients with Saturn retrograde in their chart are finding wins when gambling more often than normal. This could be attributed to the fact that during a retrograde period, all planets go into reverse gear and tend to slow down or go back over things they may have missed during the normal progression of time.

In the natal chart, Saturn Retrograde can indicate a time where you may have to revisit some past issues or karma that you need to clear before moving on. This planetary energy can also create delays or roadblocks in your life path, but it is also known as a time where you can come up with better solutions to problems due to the added focus and concentration that comes with it.

So if you are looking for some extra luck when playing games of chance, look to see if Saturn Retrograde is present in your natal chart! And who knows, maybe you will be the next big winner!

#  Saturn Retrograde in 5th House Makes You Lucky in Gambling!

Saturn retrograde is on your 5th house of gambling, betting and speculation from 8th September 2017 to 6th December 2017. This is a very good transit for you to gamble as you will be lucky and make money. You should also invest in stocks and shares as the return on investment will be high.

The main reason why you will be successful in gambling during this period is because Saturn retrograde is in your 5th house of gambling. This makes you very lucky and gives you the edge over your opponents. In addition, the planets Mars, Jupiter and Uranus are all in favorable positions, which will further increase your luck.

This is a great time to visit casinos and betting shops, as you are likely to win big during this period. However, it is important that you gamble responsibly and do not bet more than you can afford to lose. Gambling can be addictive, so it is important to stay within your limits.

If you are looking for a way to make some extra money during this period, then investing in stocks and shares could be a wise move. The planets Mars, Jupiter and Uranus are all in favorable positions, which indicates that there is a good chance of making a profit. You may want to consult an astrologer or financial advisor before making any investments though, as they will be able to advise you on the best way to maximize your profits.

So if you are feeling lucky, then now is the time to gamble! The planets are aligned in such a way that you are likely to make money during this period. Just make sure that you gamble responsibly and do not bet more than you can afford to lose.
