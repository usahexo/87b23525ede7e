#  From West Virginia to Las Vegas – The Journey of the Morgantown Casino 

The journey of the Morgantown casino started all the way back in December of 2014, when a group of investors led by West Virginia businessman Jim Justice got together to propose a multimillion dollar project to the state legislature. The proposal called for a large-scale casino and resort that would be built in downtown Morgantown, with the potential to create hundreds of jobs and bring in millions of dollars in revenue to the state each year. Unfortunately, after months of debate and discussion, the bill failed to pass the legislature.

Justice and his team didn’t give up though, and they decided to take their proposal on the road. In February of 2015, they pitched their idea to the Nevada Gaming Commission, and after months of review, the commission voted unanimously to approve the project. The new casino was given the name “Morgantown”, in honor of its West Virginia roots, and construction began shortly thereafter.

The Morgantown casino is a large-scale resort that features over 1,000 slot machines, 20 table games, and a spacious poker room. There is also a luxury hotel on site with over 300 rooms, as well as several restaurants and bars. The casino has been a big hit with visitors from all over, and it has helped to revitalize downtown Morgantown.

In addition to creating hundreds of jobs and bringing in millions of dollars in revenue each year, the Morgantown casino has also had a positive impact on the local economy. It has helped businesses throughout the region to grow and prosper, and it has encouraged people from all walks of life to visit West Virginia. Thanks to the success of the Morgantown casino, Justice is now planning on opening another casino in Charleston later this year.
