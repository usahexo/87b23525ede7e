#  Here are 5 things Paris Saint-Germain F.C. could buy with the money they've spent on green shell out on roulette!

1. Neymar - The Brazilian was the most expensive acquisition in history when PSG brought him to France from Barcelona for €222 million in 2017.

2. Kylian Mbappé - PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has insisted that Mbappé is not for sale, but the club could fetch a world-record fee for the 20-year-old were they to change their mind.

3. Marco Verratti - The Italian midfielder has been linked with a move to Real Madrid, but PSG are said to be unwilling to sell him.

4. Edinson Cavani - Cavani is PSG's all-time top scorer with 195 goals, but he has been linked with a move away from the club in recent months.

5. Thiago Silva - The Brazilian defender has been at PSG since 2012 and is considered one of the best centre-backs in the world.

#  Paris Saint-Germain F.C.'s insane spending spree: What does green shell out on roulette mean for their future?

On the eve of the new season, Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain announced they had smashed the world transfer record by signing Brazilian superstar Neymar from Spanish giants Barcelona for a whopping €222 million (£196m/$262m).

Less than 24 hours later, they did it again by signing French teenage striker Kylian Mbappé from Monaco on a season-long loan with an option to buy for €180 million (£161m/$213m),eventually making the deal permanent for €180 million, making him the second most expensive player in history.

The spending doesn't stop there, though, with PSG also bringing in midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak from Premier League side West Bromwich Albion for €30 million (£26.4m/$35.6m), as well as goalkeeper Alphonse Areola from Villarreal and defender Yuri Berchiche from Real Sociedad.

In total, PSG have spent over £650 million on new players in what can only be seen as an attempt to win the Champions League. However, some people are starting to ask whether or not this spending spree is sustainable, and if it could have negative consequences for the club in the future.

There's no doubt that PSG are now one of the biggest clubs in Europe and they are certainly capable of winning the Champions League. However, throwing this much money around is not without risk, and there's always a danger that they could become over-reliant on their big-money stars and end up struggling financially if they don't win anything major.

For now, though, it's party time in Paris as their fans revel in their team's new-found wealth. Neymar and Mbappé are certain to be crowd favourites at the Parc des Princes and with so much talent in their squad, PSG have got to be considered one of the favourites to win Europe's top prize this season.

#  How will Monaco and other teams in Ligue 1 compete against Paris Saint-Germain F.C. now that they have so much money to spend?

In the summer of 2017, Paris Saint-Germain F.C. set the world on fire by signing Brazilian superstar Neymar Jr. from Spanish giants Barcelona for a world-record fee of €222 million (£200 million). This move sent shockwaves throughout the footballing world, as it seemed to signal that PSG were now intent on becoming one of the biggest clubs in Europe – and they had the money to back it up.

Since then, they have only reinforced this notion by spending even more money in the transfer market. In January 2018, they signed French winger Kylian Mbappé from Monaco for a staggering €180 million (£166 million), making him, at just 18 years of age, the second most expensive player in history.

This has led to many people questioning how teams like Monaco – who are not used to competing with such financial powerhouses – will be able to compete against PSG in Ligue 1 now that they have so much money to spend.

It is safe to say that Monaco will not be able to match PSG dollar for dollar when it comes to transfers, but they do have other strengths that could help them compete. For starters, Monaco have a very talented young squad, which includes players like Kylian Mbappé, Bernardo Silva and Thomas Lemar. They also have a very good manager in Leonardo Jardim, who knows how to get the best out of his players.

Furthermore, Monaco are backed by a wealthy owner in Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, so they will not be short of funds when it comes to competing with PSG on the pitch. Ultimately, while PSG may be favourites to win Ligue 1 this season, Monaco should not be discounted and will definitely be a team to watch out for.

#  AS Monaco's team captain voices concerns over PSG's spending: They are buying players for twice the amount we paid for them

AS Monaco's team captain, Radamel Falcao, has voiced concerns over Paris Saint-Germain's spending. He believes that the French Ligue 1 champions are buying players for twice the amount they paid for them.

"It's not fair," Falcao said in an interview with RTL. "They are buying players for twice the amount we paid for them."

This isn't the first time that Monaco's team captain has spoken out against PSG. Last season, he was quoted as saying: "We cannot let a club like PSG buy all of the best players in the world."

While Monaco may not be able to compete with PSG financially, they have been very successful on the pitch. In fact, they reached last season's Champions League semi-finals, where they were narrowly defeated by Juventus.

This season, Monaco are currently in second place in Ligue 1, just two points behind PSG.

#  Neymar Jr.makes his debut for Paris Saint-Germain F.C.: What does this mean for the rest of Ligue 1?

It was only a matter of time before Neymar Jr.made his debut for Paris Saint-Germain F.C. The Brazilian superstar completed his world-record transfer from Barcelona to the French capital in early August, and he has been waiting in the wings ever since.

Fans of Ligue 1 have been eagerly waiting to see how strong PSG will be with Neymar in the side, and on Sunday evening, they finally got their answer. The former Santos man started and played the full 90 minutes as PSG beat Guingamp 3-0 at the Parc des Princes.

Now that Neymar has made his debut, speculation will begin to mount about whether he can help PSG win their first league title since 1994. Monaco currently lead the table by four points, but Neymar’s arrival may be just what PSG need to put an end to their long wait for success.

Of course, there are many other teams in Ligue 1 who will also be hoping to stop PSG from claiming top spot. Lyon, Marseille and Nice all stand a chance of competing for the title, but it is clear that Neymar’s presence will give PSG a huge boost.

In addition to helping them win titles, Neymar is also expected to bring in more money for PSG. His transfer fee of €222 million is a record for any player in history, and it is hoped that he will help attract new sponsors and increase gate receipts.

There is no doubt that Neymar is a huge acquisition for PSG, and his debut on Sunday evening was greeted with much enthusiasm by the club’s fans. It remains to be seen whether he can help them win their first league title in over 20 years, but there is no doubt that he will make a huge impact on French football this season.
