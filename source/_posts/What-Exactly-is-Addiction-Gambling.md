#  What Stormin 7s game is and how it works

Stormin 7s is an arcade-style game where players score points by running and dodging defenders. The game is played on a rectangular field with two end zones. There are seven players on each team, one of which is the ball carrier. The object of the game is to score a touchdown by running the ball into the opposing team’s end zone.

 Players can run or dodge opponents using three basic moves: walk, jog, and sprint. If a player is touched by an opponent, they are “tackled” and must stop running. If the ball carrier is tackled, the play ends and the other team takes possession of the ball.
