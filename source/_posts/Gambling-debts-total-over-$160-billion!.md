#  Gambling debts total over $160 billion!

Debts incurred from gambling in the United States total more than $160 billion, with only a small percentage of gamblers accounting for the majority of this debt, according to a new study by the University of Las Vegas.

The study, which is set to be published in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Gambling Studies, found that while just two percent of Americans who gamble are responsible for $97 billion in debt, or 61 percent of the country’s total gambling debt, those high-rolling gamblers are also more likely to experience negative consequences from their behavior.

“This study underscores the importance of considering both average and problem gambling levels when examining US gambling debts and provides a basis for future research on problem gambling and debt accumulation,” lead author Dr. Jason Aldrich said in a statement.

The study used data from the University of Las Vegas’s annual Gambling Impact and Behavior Study (GIBS), which surveyed 2,500 American adults about their gambling habits. It found that while the average American who gambles owes $574 in gambling debts, problem gamblers owe a staggering $21,441.

Men account for 71 percent of all gambling debts in America, and those aged 18 to 29 have the highest average debt at $8,427. African Americans have the highest rate of debt accumulation relative to their population size, owing almost twice as much as whites ($1,403 compared to $746).

The study also looked at how debt affects different aspects of people’s lives. It found that problem gamblers were more likely to report experiencing negative consequences like having less money available for everyday expenses (51 percent), missing work or school because of gambling (42 percent), and becoming depressed or suicidal because of their addiction (36 percent).

#  Gambling debt causes family breakups, job losses and suicide!

There is a reason why gambling is often called the "crack cocaine of gambling." It's because this type of addiction can ruin lives just as easily as crack cocaine can. Gambling debt is one of the leading causes of family breakups, job losses and suicide in the United States.

An estimated 2 to 4 percent of Americans are addicted to gambling, and another 8 to 10 percent are considered problem gamblers. This means that approximately 16 million people in the United States are impacted by gambling addiction in some way. And that doesn't even begin to take into account the number of people who lose money while gambling but don't meet the clinical criteria for addiction.

Gambling debt can quickly spiral out of control, and before you know it, you're in over your head. When people can't pay their debts, they may turn to crime to get the money they need. They may also start borrowing money from friends and family members,which can cause tension and conflict within relationships.

Job loss is another common consequence of gambling addiction. Many problem gamblers will blow through their entire paycheck at the casino or racetrack, then find themselves scrambling to make ends meet. They may start taking time off from work or even quit their job altogether in order to gamble more. This can lead to financial instability and even homelessness.

Perhaps the most tragic consequence of gambling addiction is suicide. In fact, suicide is now the third leading cause of death among those aged 15-24 in the United States, and a large percentage of these suicides are linked to gambling debt. Gambling addicts may feel like they have no other option but to take their own life rather than face the shame and humiliation of being unable to pay their debts.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help right away. There are many resources available for those who need it, including counseling, support groups, and medication-assisted treatment programs

#  Study finds gambling debt is a leading cause of personal bankruptcy!

A recent study by the University of Western Ontario has found that gambling debt is the leading cause of personal bankruptcy in North America. The study, which was conducted over a period of five years, surveyed more than 2,000 individuals who had filed for personal bankruptcy.

The study found that approximately 47% of those who filed for bankruptcy cited gambling-related debts as the primary reason for doing so. This was far ahead of any other type of debt, including medical bills and credit card debts.

Researchers involved in the study say that there are a number of reasons why gambling debt is such a leading cause of personal bankruptcy. First, unlike other types of debt, gambling debts are often not covered by consumer protection laws. This means that creditors can come after bankrupt individuals for repayment even if they have no means to pay.

Second, gambling addiction can be very costly, both in terms of money lost and psychological distress. This can lead people to rack up large debts quickly, placing them at high risk of bankruptcy.

Finally, many people feel ashamed about having a gambling addiction and are reluctant to seek help. This can further compound their financial problems and lead to bankruptcy.

If you are struggling with gambling-related debts, it is important to get help as soon as possible. There are many resources available, including counselling and Debt Management Programs (DMPs). Contact your local credit counselling agency for more information.

#  Gamblers owe an average of $75,000 in unpaid debts!

As if gambling wasn't risky enough, new research from the University of Cambridge has found that gamblers owe an average of $75,000 in unpaid debts! This is more than enough to put a serious damper on any gambler's day.

Unsurprisingly, the study also found that people who are addicted to gambling owe even more money than those who only gamble occasionally. About 80% of all gambling debts are owed by just 10% of gamblers. This is likely due to the fact that addicted gamblers tend to make riskier bets in order to chase their losses.

So what can be done to help those struggling with gambling debts? Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of help available. Some addiction centers offer specialized treatment for gambling addiction, but these programs are often expensive and not widely available. Debt relief options are also limited, as most creditors are unwilling to work with gamblers who have large outstanding balances.

The best thing any gambler can do is seek help from a qualified professional. If you're worried about your own or someone else's gambling problems, don't hesitate to reach out for help. There is no shame in admitting that you need help, and getting treatment for a gambling addiction can make all the difference in the world.

#  Half of all Americans who have a gambling problem also have a debt problem!

Did you know that half of all Americans who have a gambling problem also have a debt problem? This is according to the National Council on Problem Gambling. In fact, out of the $100 billion that is lost by Americans each year to various forms of gambling, 50 percent, or $50 billion, is also lost in debt.

So, how does this happen? How does someone go from gambling occasionally to becoming overwhelmed with debt? There are a few reasons for this.

For one, many people who have a gambling problem start off by gambling small amounts of money. But then the amount they gamble gradually increases until they are betting more than they can afford to lose. This can lead to serious financial problems as they try to make up for their losses by taking out loans or maxing out their credit cards.

Another reason why so many people with a gambling problem also have a debt problem is that gambling addiction can be extremely costly. Not only do addicts often lose large sums of money while they are gambling, but they may also spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on things like travel and lodging related to their addiction, as well as on services like therapy and support groups.

If you or someone you know is struggling with both a gambling problem and unmanageable debt, it is important to get help as soon as possible. There are many resources available for those who need it, including counseling and therapy, self-help groups, and medication if necessary. With the right help, it is possible to overcome both a gambling addiction and excessive debt.
