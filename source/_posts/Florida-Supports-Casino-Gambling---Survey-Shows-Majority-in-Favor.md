#  Florida Supports Casino Gambling - Survey Shows Majority in Favor

A new survey by the University of Florida shows that a majority of Floridians now support casino gambling. The poll results indicate that 54 percent of residents are in favor of legalizing casinos, while only 37 percent oppose the idea.

The shift in opinion may be due to the state’s dismal economy. With unemployment and home values both on the rise, some people may see gambling as a way to generate new revenue for the government.

Casinos are currently banned in Florida, but there is growing pressure to legalize them. In November, a bill was filed in the state Senate that would allow up to eight casinos in four different counties.

Supporters of casino gambling argue that it would create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to the state. Opponents say that it would lead to increased crime and addiction problems.

The issue is sure to be a hot topic during next year’s legislative session.

#  Florida Moves Towards Legalizing Casino Gambling

For years, casino gambling has been a contentious issue in the state of Florida. Republican lawmakers have staunchly opposed any proposals to legalize it, while Democrats and some industry officials have argued that it would bring much-needed revenue to the cash-strapped state.

Now, however, there may be a shift in sentiment among Republicans, as a number of them have come out in favor of legalizing casino gambling. This came about after the state's Supreme Court ruled last year that casino gambling is not unconstitutional, as previously thought.

This new development could pave the way for lawmakers to pass a bill legalizing casino gambling during the upcoming legislative session. Such a bill is likely to face strong opposition from Republicans, but could pass if there is enough support among Democrats and moderate Republicans.

Casino gambling is currently legal in only a handful of states, including Nevada and New Jersey. If Florida were to legalize it, it would be the largest market for casino gambling in the country.

#  Majority of Floridians Support Casino Gambling

In a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday, 57 percent of Florida voters say they support casino gambling in the state. Only 33 percent were opposed.

The issue has been divisive in the past, but with casinos now operating in seven states, and more likely on the way, Floridians may be ready to change their tune. MGM Resorts International is currently seeking to build a $2.5 billion casino resort in Miami.

“As other states legalize it and people see the economic development and jobs it brings, our poll numbers have gone up,” said Daniel Hansen, a lobbyist for Las Vegas Sands Corp., which is also seeking to build a casino in Miami.

Opposition to casinos has traditionally come from religious groups and rural communities that see them as threats to their way of life. But with Florida's population growing and tourists spending more money every year, casinos are becoming an increasingly attractive option for state lawmakers looking for new sources of revenue.

A bill authorizing casino gambling in Florida died in the House last year, but there is sure to be more debate this year with new polls showing strong public support.

#  Statewide Poll Shows Overwhelming Support for Casino Gambling

A new statewide poll shows that the majority of Pennsylvania voters support casino gambling. The poll, which was conducted by Franklin & Marshall College, found that 58% of respondents said they supported casino gambling, while only 33% were opposed.

This is good news for Governor Tom Wolf, who has been a strong supporter of legalizing casino gambling in the state. Just last month, he announced a plan to allow licenses for 10 new casinos in Pennsylvania. This would bring in an estimated $200 million in new revenue for the state each year.

Opponents of casino gambling argue that it could lead to increased crime and addiction rates. However, supporters say that it would create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue for the state.

A decision on whether or not to legalize casino gambling is expected to be made later this year.

#  Floridians Overwhelmingly Favor Casino Gambling

A recent poll shows that a majority of Floridians favor casino gambling.

The poll, conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling & Research, Inc., found that 54% of Florida voters support legalizing casino gambling in the state, while only 36% are opposed. The remaining 10% are undecided.

The news comes as legislators begin to debate the issue in Tallahassee. The House has already passed a bill that would allow three resort casinos, while the Senate is still debating its own bill, which calls for five casinos.

Governor Rick Scott has said he would veto any bill that allows more than seven casinos in the state.

Supporters of casino gambling say it would generate much-needed revenue for the state and create jobs. Opponents argue that it would lead to increased crime and addiction rates.
