#  Bingo for a good cause in Rwanda!

Since 2010, the game of bingo has been raising funds for charity in Rwanda. The Bingo for a Good Cause event is hosted by the Kigali Arts and Culture Festival and all proceeds go to supporting vulnerable groups in the Rwandan community, such as orphans and widows.

Though small in size, this East African country is home to many charities and humanitarian initiatives. One such example is Seeds of Peace, an organization that promotes peace and reconciliation through education programs for young people from regions of conflict.

The work done by Seeds of Peace and other organizations is vital to Rwanda’s continued progress after the devastating genocide of 1994. This dark period in the country’s history left over a million people dead and many more displaced or orphaned.

In recent years, Rwanda has made incredible strides in rebuilding its society. The government has put in place policies aimed at reconciliation and economic development. Additionally, there has been a concerted effort to support vulnerable groups within society, including women and children.

The Bingo for a Good Cause event is just one example of the work being done to help those most in need. It provides much-needed funds for programs that improve the quality of life for all Rwandans. So come on down to Kigali for some good old-fashioned fun – and do some good at the same time!
