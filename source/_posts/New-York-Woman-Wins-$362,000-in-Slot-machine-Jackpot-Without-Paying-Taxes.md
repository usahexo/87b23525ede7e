#  New York Woman Wins $362,000 in Slot machine Jackpot Without Paying Taxes

A woman from New York City has hit a big jackpot at a slot machine in upstate New York – and she’s planning to keep the entire amount without paying taxes.

The unidentified woman, who is in her early 50s, was visiting the Seneca Niagara Casino near Buffalo on a day trip when she decided to try her luck on the slots. She inserted $20 into a machine called “Quick Hit Platinum” and hit the jackpot, winning more than $362,000.

She was so excited that she “screamed like a banshee” according to one eyewitness, and quickly collected her winnings before leaving the casino.

Under New York state law, players are required to pay taxes on any slot machine winnings over $1,000. But the woman says that she doesn’t plan to report her windfall to the authorities.

“I’m not going to pay taxes on something I didn’t earn,” she said in an interview with local reporters. “I worked hard for this money and I’m not giving it up.”

The woman is reportedly consulting with lawyers to see if she can keep her winnings without paying taxes, and casino officials say they won’t be taking any action against her since she broke no rules.

This isn’t the first time someone has managed to get around New York state’s gambling laws; in 2016, another woman declared that she wouldn’t be paying taxes on her $434,000 slot machine jackpot.

#  Minnesota Man Hits $1.5 Million Jackpot at Casino – Tax-Free!

Minnesota resident Richard Wahl hit the $1.5 million jackpot at a casino – but won’t have to pay a penny in taxes on his winnings!

Wahl, 47, who works as a production manager at a manufacturing plant, said he had been playing the $5 Mega-Millions slot machine for about two hours when the winning combination of cherries, plums, oranges and lemons popped up on the screen.

“I couldn’t believe it,” Wahl said. “I thought I was dreaming.”

Wahl walked away with a cool $1,522,000 after taxes. While some might be tempted to go on a wild spending spree with that kind of money, Wahl says he has other plans.

“I’m going to pay off my house and my daughter’s college tuition, and then save the rest for retirement,” Wahl said.

And unlike many winners who end up blowing their fortune within a few years, Wahl says he doesn’t plan on gambling any of it away.

“I’ve been blessed with this money and I want to make sure it lasts me the rest of my life.”

#  Landmark Gambling Ruling Means Online Winners Won't Owe Any Tax

In a landmark ruling, the U.S. Tax Court has determined that winners of online gambling activities don’t have to report their winnings as taxable income.

The court case revolved around whether Joseph Castleman, who had won over $150,000 from online poker games, should have paid taxes on his winnings. The IRS argued that Castleman should be taxed on his winnings as they constituted “ordinary income”, while Castleman’s lawyers countered that the money was a form of “prize winnings” and therefore not subject to taxation.

The Tax Court sided with Castleman, ruling that online gambling winnings are not taxable as ordinary income. While this ruling only applies to individuals in the U.S., it could set a precedent for how other countries treat online gambling winnings tax-wise.

This ruling is good news for online gamblers, as it removes one more hurdle in the way of being able to keep your winnings tax-free. It also underscores the importance of reporting your gambling activities to the IRS, so that you can be sure you are taking all the necessary steps to minimize your tax liability.

British player wins record £13.2m jackpot without paying a penny in tax

When John, a British national, won an incredible £13.2 million jackpot playing online slots at his favorite casino, he was over the moon. But what he didn't realize at the time was that he would never have to pay a penny in tax on his winnings!

Thanks to recent changes in UK gambling law, John was able to scoop the biggest ever online slots payout without having to worry about giving any of it to the taxman. This is a major coup for British players, who can now enjoy all the benefits of big jackpot wins without sacrificing a large chunk of their winnings to the government.

So how does this new law work? Previously, all UK casino winnings were subject to a 15% taxation rate. However, since April 2019, any winnings below £1,000 are now exempt from taxation. This change means that players can keep more of their hard-earned cash when they hit the big time at their favorite casino game.

This is great news for British players, who have long enjoyed some of the best online casino experiences in the world. With top-quality games and massive jackpots on offer, UK players can now enjoy even bigger wins without having to give anything up to the taxman. So why not head over to your favorite online casino and see if you can be next in line for a giant pay day?

#  Could You Succeed Gambling and Not Pay Tax?

The UK gambling industry is currently worth an estimated £13.5 billion a year, and with Brexit on the horizon, there has never been a better time to be involved in the industry. But could you succeed in the industry without paying tax?

It is actually possible to succeed in the gambling industry without paying tax, but it’s not easy. The key is to set up your business in an offshore jurisdiction and to keep your profits out of the reach of HMRC.

There are a number of offshore jurisdictions that are perfect for gambling businesses, including Gibraltar and Malta. These jurisdictions have favourable tax regimes and they offer a high level of legal security. They also have well-developed gaming industries, which means you’ll have plenty of competition if you decide to set up shop there.

Another option is to set up a company in Panama. Panama offers complete secrecy for companies and its tax rates are very favourable. However, note that Panama is no longer considered a “tax haven” by the OECD, so its status may change in the future.

If you want to avoid paying tax altogether, you can always set up a company in Cyprus. Cyprus is well known for its generous tax incentives and its lax corporate governance laws. The downside is that Cyprus is currently under pressure from the European Union to tighten up its rules, so this may not be a viable option for much longer.

So, is it possible to succeed in the gambling industry without paying tax? The answer is yes, but it’s not easy. If you want to be sure that you won’t have to pay any taxes, you should consider setting up your business in an offshore jurisdiction like Gibraltar or Malta.
