#  New Casino Game: White Russian Blackjack

Online casino games are always popular with players, and providers are always looking for new games to keep players interested. One new game that has been gaining in popularity is White Russian Blackjack. This game is similar to the classic blackjack game, but with a few twists that make it unique.

The basic rules of blackjack still apply in this game. The player must beat the dealer by getting a higher score than the dealer without going over 21. In White Russian Blackjack, however, there are a few additional rules that make the game more exciting.

The first twist is that players can choose to split their cards two different ways. They can either split them into two separate hands, or they can split them and form a three-card hand. This gives players more flexibility when it comes to playing their hand.

Another twist is the inclusion of a bonus round. If the player gets a blackjack (two cards of the same rank) and also has a White Russian cocktail in their hand, they will automatically enter the bonus round. In this round, they will be given six cards, and they must choose three to keep. The other three cards will be discarded, and the player’s final score will be calculated based on the three cards they kept. This can lead to some big payouts if you get lucky!

If you’re looking for a new and exciting casino game to try out, White Russian Blackjack is definitely worth checking out!

Looking for an online casino with a twist? Then you'll love white Russian blackjack at Blue Chip Casino! This fun and unique game is similar to blackjack, but with a few extra rules that make it even more exciting. Read on to learn all about this unique game and how to play it.

In white Russian blackjack, the goal is to beat the dealer by either getting closer to 21 than the dealer, or by making the dealer go bust. The basic rules of blackjack apply, but there are a few twists that make this game more interesting.

For starters, in white Russian blackjack you can double down after splitting. This gives you more chances to win big bucks! You can also split your cards twice, giving you four separate hands to play with.

Another difference between white Russian blackjack and regular blackjack is that in this game, Ace can be worth one or eleven points. This makes the game more strategic, as you need to decide whether to take risks in order to get closer to 21 or play it safe and hope the dealer goes bust.
