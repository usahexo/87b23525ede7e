You couldn’t be more wrong! With a bit of creativity and planning, you can visit this amazing country on a budget. Here are some tips to help you get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Book your flight well in advance.</li>
</ol>
<p>Like with most destinations, the earlier you book your flight, the cheaper it will be. Try to book at least three months in advance to get the best deal.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Find accommodation outside of Havana.</li>
</ol>
<p>Havana is a beautiful city, but it is also the most expensive place to stay in Cuba. Instead, consider staying in one of the smaller towns or villages outside of Havana. You can find some great deals on accommodation this way.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Travel by bus instead of taxi.</li>
</ol>
<p>Taxi fares in Cuba can be quite expensive, especially if you are travelling between cities. Instead, travel by bus – it’s a much cheaper option. Just make sure you have enough pesos convertibles (CUC) to pay for your fare.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Eat like a local!</li>
</ol>
<p>Eating out in Cuba can be quite expensive, so it’s a good idea to eat like the locals do and buy food from street stalls or markets instead. You can get some great food at a fraction of the price this way. Be adventurous and try something new – you won’t regret it!</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Drink tap water rather than buying bottled water.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bottled water is not only expensive in Cuba, but it’s also not always safe to drink. Stick to drinking tap water instead – it’s perfectly safe and will save you a lot of money in the long run.</p>
<h1 id="5-tips-for-blackjack-in-Cuba"><a href="#5-tips-for-blackjack-in-Cuba" class="headerlink" title="5 tips for blackjack in Cuba"></a>5 tips for blackjack in Cuba</h1><p>Blackjack, or “21” as it is known in Cuba, is one of the most popular casino games in the world. While the game may seem simple at first, there are a few things you can do to increase your chances of winning and enjoying your time at the casino table. Here are five tips for playing blackjack in Cuba:</p>
<ol>
<li>Know the basic rules</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step to becoming a successful blackjack player is understanding the basic rules of the game. Blackjack is played with one or more decks of cards, and the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player loses if they go over 21, and the dealer wins if they have a higher total than the player. If both players have the same total, it is called a “push” and no one wins or loses money.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Learn how to count cards</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to give yourself an edge against the dealer is to learn how to count cards. This involves keeping track of which cards have been played so that you can make better decisions about when to hit and stand. It takes some practice but once you get good at it, you can gain a significant advantage over the house.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Bet wisely</li>
</ol>
<p>Another important thing to remember when playing blackjack is to bet wisely. Don’t bet too much money on any one hand, especially if you are still learning the game. Spread your bets out among different hands and only bet what you can afford to lose. That way, even if you do lose some hands, it won’t affect your bank balance too much.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Use strategy charts</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to make things even easier for yourself, use strategy charts while playing blackjack. These charts list all of the possible decisions that you can make during a hand and tell you what the best move is in each situation. You can find free online versions of these charts or print them out before you head to the casino table.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Be patient<br> scourge of casinos around</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-trip-to-Cuba"><a href="#How-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-trip-to-Cuba" class="headerlink" title="How to get the most out of your trip to Cuba"></a>How to get the most out of your trip to Cuba</h1><p>When most people think of Cuba, they think of cigars, rum, and beaches. While those things are all certainly a big part of the Cuban experience, there is so much more to see and do on the island. Here are some tips for getting the most out of your trip to Cuba.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have the right visa</li>
</ol>
<p>Cuba is one of the few countries in the world that requires a visa for entry. Tourists need what is called a “tourist card”, which can be obtained from your travel agent or online. Make sure you have one before you arrive in Cuba as there are no ATMs or currency exchange desks at the airport. You will also need your passport with at least six months remaining validity.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Learn some basic Spanish phrases</li>
</ol>
<p>While English is widely spoken in Cuba, learning a few basic Spanish phrases will make your trip smoother and help you connect with locals more easily. Some essentials include “hello” (hola), “thank you” (gracias), “how much does this cost?” (cuanto cuesta esto?), and “where is _____?” (donde esta _____?).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Rent a bicycle or take public transportation</li>
</ol>
<p>Cuba is a great place to explore by bike. Not only is it a fun way to get around, but it’s also a great way to see the sights and meet locals. If cycling isn’t your thing, then take public transportation instead – taxis, buses, and shared taxis are all common in Cuba. Just be prepared for them to be rather crowded!</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Visit Havana Vieja</li>
</ol>
<p>Havana Vieja – or Old Havana – is an absolute must-see when visiting Cuba. This historic district is full of colonial architecture, lively plazas, restaurants, bars, and shops. It’s also home to some of the country’s best museums, including the Museum of Revolution and the National Museum of Fine Arts.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Try some Cuban cuisine</li>
</ol>
<p>Cuban food is a mix of Caribbean, Spanish, African, and Chinese flavors and ingredients. Some classics include botanas (Appetizers), such as croquetas (croquettes), empanadas ( turnovers), frituras (fried snacks), and masitas de puerco (pork hash); main dishes like ropa vieja (shredded beef stew) and arroz con pollo (chicken rice); and desserts like mango con chicle (mango with chewing gum) and tres leches cake (a sponge cake soaked in three different types of milk). Be sure to try as much Cuban food as possible while you’re in country – you won’t be disappointed!</p>
<h1 id="What-to-see-and-do-in-Cuba"><a href="#What-to-see-and-do-in-Cuba" class="headerlink" title="What to see and do in Cuba"></a>What to see and do in Cuba</h1><p><code>Cuba</code> is a place of beautiful beaches, stunning architecture and amazing music. With so much to see and do, it can be difficult to know where to start. Here is a guide to some of the best that Cuba has to offer:</p>
<p>#Havana</p>
<p>The capital of Cuba, Havana, is a city that must be seen. With its vibrant culture, architecture and nightlife, Havana is a city not to be missed. Start by exploring the old town, where you will find winding streets and colonial-era buildings. Be sure to check out La Floridita bar, which is home to the daiquiri. For some amazing views of the city, head to the top of Morro Castle.</p>
<p>#Beaches</p>
<p>Cuba is world-famous for its stunning beaches. Among the best are Varadero Beach, which offers white sand and crystal clear waters; Cayo Largo del Sur Beach, with its unspoilt surroundings and crystal-clear waters; and Cojimar Beach, known for its excellent diving opportunities.</p>
<p>#Music</p>
<p>Cuba is home to some of the world’s best music. The country’s most famous musician is undoubtedly Fidel Castro’s brother, Raul Castro. While in Cuba be sure to check out one of his concerts – you won’t be disappointed! Elsewhere in Cuba you can listen to everything from jazz and blues to son and rumba.</p>
<h1 id="Traveling-to-Cuba-What-you-need-to-know"><a href="#Traveling-to-Cuba-What-you-need-to-know" class="headerlink" title="Traveling to Cuba: What you need to know!"></a>Traveling to Cuba: What you need to know!</h1><p>In February of 2016, the Obama administration made a significant change to the United States’ policy towards Cuba. This change allowed for Americans to travel to Cuba for any reason, without having to seek prior approval from the government. However, there are still some restrictions in place which you should be aware of before planning your trip.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is ensure that you are traveling to Cuba under one of the 12 approved categories. These categories are: family visits, official business of the US government, journalistic activity, professional research and professional meetings, educational activities, religious activities, public performances, support for the Cuban people, humanitarian projects, activities of private foundations or research or educational institutes, and export&#x2F;import operations that primarily benefit the Cuban people. If your reason for traveling does not fall into one of these categories, you will not be able to travel to Cuba legally.</p>
<p>Another important thing to note is that while you are now able to travel to Cuba under any of the 12 approved categories, you are still not allowed to spend money in Cuba on tourism-related activities. What this means is that you cannot use your American debit or credit card while in Cuba; instead, you will need to bring cash with you. You can exchange your currency for Cuban Convertible Pesos (CUC) once you arrive in Cuba.</p>
<p>One final restriction that still exists is that American citizens are not allowed to travel to Cuba as part of a group tour. If you plan on traveling independently, you will need to make all of your own arrangements (including booking your accommodation and transportation).</p>
<p>Despite these restrictions, there are still plenty of reasons why Americans might want to visit Cuba. The country is home to beautiful beaches, stunning architecture, and rich culture and history. And while it’s true that it can be more complicated than other destinations to travel in Cuba legally as an American citizen, it’s definitely worth it!</p>
