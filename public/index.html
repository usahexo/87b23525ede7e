        <h1 id="Gambling-debts-total-over-160-billion"><a href="#Gambling-debts-total-over-160-billion" class="headerlink" title="Gambling debts total over $160 billion!"></a>Gambling debts total over $160 billion!</h1><p>Debts incurred from gambling in the United States total more than $160 billion, with only a small percentage of gamblers accounting for the majority of this debt, according to a new study by the University of Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The study, which is set to be published in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Gambling Studies, found that while just two percent of Americans who gamble are responsible for $97 billion in debt, or 61 percent of the country’s total gambling debt, those high-rolling gamblers are also more likely to experience negative consequences from their behavior.</p>
<p>“This study underscores the importance of considering both average and problem gambling levels when examining US gambling debts and provides a basis for future research on problem gambling and debt accumulation,” lead author Dr. Jason Aldrich said in a statement.</p>
<p>The study used data from the University of Las Vegas’s annual Gambling Impact and Behavior Study (GIBS), which surveyed 2,500 American adults about their gambling habits. It found that while the average American who gambles owes $574 in gambling debts, problem gamblers owe a staggering $21,441.</p>
<p>Men account for 71 percent of all gambling debts in America, and those aged 18 to 29 have the highest average debt at $8,427. African Americans have the highest rate of debt accumulation relative to their population size, owing almost twice as much as whites ($1,403 compared to $746).</p>
<p>The study also looked at how debt affects different aspects of people’s lives. It found that problem gamblers were more likely to report experiencing negative consequences like having less money available for everyday expenses (51 percent), missing work or school because of gambling (42 percent), and becoming depressed or suicidal because of their addiction (36 percent).</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-debt-causes-family-breakups-job-losses-and-suicide"><a href="#Gambling-debt-causes-family-breakups-job-losses-and-suicide" class="headerlink" title="Gambling debt causes family breakups, job losses and suicide!"></a>Gambling debt causes family breakups, job losses and suicide!</h1><p>There is a reason why gambling is often called the “crack cocaine of gambling.” It’s because this type of addiction can ruin lives just as easily as crack cocaine can. Gambling debt is one of the leading causes of family breakups, job losses and suicide in the United States.</p>
<p>An estimated 2 to 4 percent of Americans are addicted to gambling, and another 8 to 10 percent are considered problem gamblers. This means that approximately 16 million people in the United States are impacted by gambling addiction in some way. And that doesn’t even begin to take into account the number of people who lose money while gambling but don’t meet the clinical criteria for addiction.</p>
<p>Gambling debt can quickly spiral out of control, and before you know it, you’re in over your head. When people can’t pay their debts, they may turn to crime to get the money they need. They may also start borrowing money from friends and family members,which can cause tension and conflict within relationships.</p>
<p>Job loss is another common consequence of gambling addiction. Many problem gamblers will blow through their entire paycheck at the casino or racetrack, then find themselves scrambling to make ends meet. They may start taking time off from work or even quit their job altogether in order to gamble more. This can lead to financial instability and even homelessness.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most tragic consequence of gambling addiction is suicide. In fact, suicide is now the third leading cause of death among those aged 15-24 in the United States, and a large percentage of these suicides are linked to gambling debt. Gambling addicts may feel like they have no other option but to take their own life rather than face the shame and humiliation of being unable to pay their debts.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help right away. There are many resources available for those who need it, including counseling, support groups, and medication-assisted treatment programs</p>
<h1 id="Study-finds-gambling-debt-is-a-leading-cause-of-personal-bankruptcy"><a href="#Study-finds-gambling-debt-is-a-leading-cause-of-personal-bankruptcy" class="headerlink" title="Study finds gambling debt is a leading cause of personal bankruptcy!"></a>Study finds gambling debt is a leading cause of personal bankruptcy!</h1><p>A recent study by the University of Western Ontario has found that gambling debt is the leading cause of personal bankruptcy in North America. The study, which was conducted over a period of five years, surveyed more than 2,000 individuals who had filed for personal bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The study found that approximately 47% of those who filed for bankruptcy cited gambling-related debts as the primary reason for doing so. This was far ahead of any other type of debt, including medical bills and credit card debts.</p>
<p>Researchers involved in the study say that there are a number of reasons why gambling debt is such a leading cause of personal bankruptcy. First, unlike other types of debt, gambling debts are often not covered by consumer protection laws. This means that creditors can come after bankrupt individuals for repayment even if they have no means to pay.</p>
<p>Second, gambling addiction can be very costly, both in terms of money lost and psychological distress. This can lead people to rack up large debts quickly, placing them at high risk of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Finally, many people feel ashamed about having a gambling addiction and are reluctant to seek help. This can further compound their financial problems and lead to bankruptcy.</p>
<p>If you are struggling with gambling-related debts, it is important to get help as soon as possible. There are many resources available, including counselling and Debt Management Programs (DMPs). Contact your local credit counselling agency for more information.</p>
<h1 id="Gamblers-owe-an-average-of-75-000-in-unpaid-debts"><a href="#Gamblers-owe-an-average-of-75-000-in-unpaid-debts" class="headerlink" title="Gamblers owe an average of $75,000 in unpaid debts!"></a>Gamblers owe an average of $75,000 in unpaid debts!</h1><p>As if gambling wasn’t risky enough, new research from the University of Cambridge has found that gamblers owe an average of $75,000 in unpaid debts! This is more than enough to put a serious damper on any gambler’s day.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the study also found that people who are addicted to gambling owe even more money than those who only gamble occasionally. About 80% of all gambling debts are owed by just 10% of gamblers. This is likely due to the fact that addicted gamblers tend to make riskier bets in order to chase their losses.</p>
<p>So what can be done to help those struggling with gambling debts? Unfortunately, there isn’t a lot of help available. Some addiction centers offer specialized treatment for gambling addiction, but these programs are often expensive and not widely available. Debt relief options are also limited, as most creditors are unwilling to work with gamblers who have large outstanding balances.</p>
<p>The best thing any gambler can do is seek help from a qualified professional. If you’re worried about your own or someone else’s gambling problems, don’t hesitate to reach out for help. There is no shame in admitting that you need help, and getting treatment for a gambling addiction can make all the difference in the world.</p>
<h1 id="Half-of-all-Americans-who-have-a-gambling-problem-also-have-a-debt-problem"><a href="#Half-of-all-Americans-who-have-a-gambling-problem-also-have-a-debt-problem" class="headerlink" title="Half of all Americans who have a gambling problem also have a debt problem!"></a>Half of all Americans who have a gambling problem also have a debt problem!</h1><p>Did you know that half of all Americans who have a gambling problem also have a debt problem? This is according to the National Council on Problem Gambling. In fact, out of the $100 billion that is lost by Americans each year to various forms of gambling, 50 percent, or $50 billion, is also lost in debt.</p>
<p>So, how does this happen? How does someone go from gambling occasionally to becoming overwhelmed with debt? There are a few reasons for this.</p>
<p>For one, many people who have a gambling problem start off by gambling small amounts of money. But then the amount they gamble gradually increases until they are betting more than they can afford to lose. This can lead to serious financial problems as they try to make up for their losses by taking out loans or maxing out their credit cards.</p>
<p>Another reason why so many people with a gambling problem also have a debt problem is that gambling addiction can be extremely costly. Not only do addicts often lose large sums of money while they are gambling, but they may also spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on things like travel and lodging related to their addiction, as well as on services like therapy and support groups.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with both a gambling problem and unmanageable debt, it is important to get help as soon as possible. There are many resources available for those who need it, including counseling and therapy, self-help groups, and medication if necessary. With the right help, it is possible to overcome both a gambling addiction and excessive debt.</p>

        <h1 id="Florida-Supports-Casino-Gambling-Survey-Shows-Majority-in-Favor"><a href="#Florida-Supports-Casino-Gambling-Survey-Shows-Majority-in-Favor" class="headerlink" title="Florida Supports Casino Gambling - Survey Shows Majority in Favor"></a>Florida Supports Casino Gambling - Survey Shows Majority in Favor</h1><p>A new survey by the University of Florida shows that a majority of Floridians now support casino gambling. The poll results indicate that 54 percent of residents are in favor of legalizing casinos, while only 37 percent oppose the idea.</p>
<p>The shift in opinion may be due to the state’s dismal economy. With unemployment and home values both on the rise, some people may see gambling as a way to generate new revenue for the government.</p>
<p>Casinos are currently banned in Florida, but there is growing pressure to legalize them. In November, a bill was filed in the state Senate that would allow up to eight casinos in four different counties.</p>
<p>Supporters of casino gambling argue that it would create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue to the state. Opponents say that it would lead to increased crime and addiction problems.</p>
<p>The issue is sure to be a hot topic during next year’s legislative session.</p>
<h1 id="Florida-Moves-Towards-Legalizing-Casino-Gambling"><a href="#Florida-Moves-Towards-Legalizing-Casino-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Florida Moves Towards Legalizing Casino Gambling"></a>Florida Moves Towards Legalizing Casino Gambling</h1><p>For years, casino gambling has been a contentious issue in the state of Florida. Republican lawmakers have staunchly opposed any proposals to legalize it, while Democrats and some industry officials have argued that it would bring much-needed revenue to the cash-strapped state.</p>
<p>Now, however, there may be a shift in sentiment among Republicans, as a number of them have come out in favor of legalizing casino gambling. This came about after the state’s Supreme Court ruled last year that casino gambling is not unconstitutional, as previously thought.</p>
<p>This new development could pave the way for lawmakers to pass a bill legalizing casino gambling during the upcoming legislative session. Such a bill is likely to face strong opposition from Republicans, but could pass if there is enough support among Democrats and moderate Republicans.</p>
<p>Casino gambling is currently legal in only a handful of states, including Nevada and New Jersey. If Florida were to legalize it, it would be the largest market for casino gambling in the country.</p>
<h1 id="Majority-of-Floridians-Support-Casino-Gambling"><a href="#Majority-of-Floridians-Support-Casino-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Majority of Floridians Support Casino Gambling"></a>Majority of Floridians Support Casino Gambling</h1><p>In a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday, 57 percent of Florida voters say they support casino gambling in the state. Only 33 percent were opposed.</p>
<p>The issue has been divisive in the past, but with casinos now operating in seven states, and more likely on the way, Floridians may be ready to change their tune. MGM Resorts International is currently seeking to build a $2.5 billion casino resort in Miami.</p>
<p>“As other states legalize it and people see the economic development and jobs it brings, our poll numbers have gone up,” said Daniel Hansen, a lobbyist for Las Vegas Sands Corp., which is also seeking to build a casino in Miami.</p>
<p>Opposition to casinos has traditionally come from religious groups and rural communities that see them as threats to their way of life. But with Florida’s population growing and tourists spending more money every year, casinos are becoming an increasingly attractive option for state lawmakers looking for new sources of revenue.</p>
<p>A bill authorizing casino gambling in Florida died in the House last year, but there is sure to be more debate this year with new polls showing strong public support.</p>
<h1 id="Statewide-Poll-Shows-Overwhelming-Support-for-Casino-Gambling"><a href="#Statewide-Poll-Shows-Overwhelming-Support-for-Casino-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Statewide Poll Shows Overwhelming Support for Casino Gambling"></a>Statewide Poll Shows Overwhelming Support for Casino Gambling</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>A new statewide poll shows that the majority of Pennsylvania voters support casino gambling. The poll, which was conducted by Franklin &amp; Marshall College, found that 58% of respondents said they supported casino gambling, while only 33% were opposed.</p>
<p>This is good news for Governor Tom Wolf, who has been a strong supporter of legalizing casino gambling in the state. Just last month, he announced a plan to allow licenses for 10 new casinos in Pennsylvania. This would bring in an estimated $200 million in new revenue for the state each year.</p>
<p>Opponents of casino gambling argue that it could lead to increased crime and addiction rates. However, supporters say that it would create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue for the state.</p>
<p>A decision on whether or not to legalize casino gambling is expected to be made later this year.</p>
<h1 id="Floridians-Overwhelmingly-Favor-Casino-Gambling"><a href="#Floridians-Overwhelmingly-Favor-Casino-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Floridians Overwhelmingly Favor Casino Gambling"></a>Floridians Overwhelmingly Favor Casino Gambling</h1><p>A recent poll shows that a majority of Floridians favor casino gambling.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Research, Inc., found that 54% of Florida voters support legalizing casino gambling in the state, while only 36% are opposed. The remaining 10% are undecided.</p>
<p>The news comes as legislators begin to debate the issue in Tallahassee. The House has already passed a bill that would allow three resort casinos, while the Senate is still debating its own bill, which calls for five casinos.</p>
<p>Governor Rick Scott has said he would veto any bill that allows more than seven casinos in the state.</p>
<p>Supporters of casino gambling say it would generate much-needed revenue for the state and create jobs. Opponents argue that it would lead to increased crime and addiction rates.</p>

In the case of gambling addiction, the person compulsively gambles despite the fact that it may cause financial problems, damage relationships, or lead to other harmful consequences.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, between 2 and 3 percent of Americans are addicted to gambling. That means there are millions of people in the United States who struggle with this condition.</p>
<p>What Causes Gambling Addiction?</p>
<p>There is no one answer to this question. Some people may be more likely to develop an addiction to gambling due to their biology or genetics. Others may be more likely to develop an addiction due to their psychology or life experiences.</p>
<p>However, there are some things that increase a person’s risk of developing a gambling addiction. These include:</p>
<p>• Having a family history of addiction<br> • Experiencing stressful life events • Having poor mental health • Having low self-esteem • Feeling isolated or lonely • Having easy access to gambling venues</p>
<p>How Does Gambling Addiction Impact People’s Lives?</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have a significant impact on people’s lives. It can lead to financial problems, ruined relationships, and even criminal activity. Here are some of the most common ways that gambling addiction impacts people’s lives:</p>
<p>• Financial problems – Gambling addicts often spend large amounts of money on gambling, which can lead to financial problems. This may include borrowing money from friends and family members, going into debt, or even filing for bankruptcy. • Relationship problems – Gambling can strain relationships with friends and family members. This is because loved ones often feel angry, frustrated, and betrayed when they find out about their loved one’s gambling addiction. Additionally, addicts often lie about their gambling activities and debts, which can further damage relationships. • Legal issues – Gambling addicts sometimes commit crimes in order to get money to gamble with. This may include stealing money or goods from others, fraudulent activities such as identity theft, or gambling illegally online. • Health problems – Gambling addiction can also lead to health problems such as stress-related illnesses, heart disease, and even suicide attempts</p>

The game is played on a rectangular field with two end zones. There are seven players on each team, one of which is the ball carrier. The object of the game is to score a touchdown by running the ball into the opposing team’s end zone.</p>
<p> Players can run or dodge opponents using three basic moves: walk, jog, and sprint. If a player is touched by an opponent, they are “tackled” and must stop running. If the ball carrier is tackled, the play ends and the other team takes possession of the ball.</p>
<p>Stormin 7s is a fast-paced game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages.</p>

The affect of this planetary transit is said to be one of enhanced luck when it comes to playing games of chance!</p>
<p>As an astrologer, I have found that my clients with Saturn retrograde in their chart are finding wins when gambling more often than normal. This could be attributed to the fact that during a retrograde period, all planets go into reverse gear and tend to slow down or go back over things they may have missed during the normal progression of time.</p>
<p>In the natal chart, Saturn Retrograde can indicate a time where you may have to revisit some past issues or karma that you need to clear before moving on. This planetary energy can also create delays or roadblocks in your life path, but it is also known as a time where you can come up with better solutions to problems due to the added focus and concentration that comes with it.</p>
<p>So if you are looking for some extra luck when playing games of chance, look to see if Saturn Retrograde is present in your natal chart! And who knows, maybe you will be the next big winner!</p>
<h1 id="Saturn-Retrograde-in-5th-House-Makes-You-Lucky-in-Gambling"><a href="#Saturn-Retrograde-in-5th-House-Makes-You-Lucky-in-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Saturn Retrograde in 5th House Makes You Lucky in Gambling!"></a>Saturn Retrograde in 5th House Makes You Lucky in Gambling!</h1><p>Saturn retrograde is on your 5th house of gambling, betting and speculation from 8th September 2017 to 6th December 2017. This is a very good transit for you to gamble as you will be lucky and make money. You should also invest in stocks and shares as the return on investment will be high.</p>
<p>The main reason why you will be successful in gambling during this period is because Saturn retrograde is in your 5th house of gambling. This makes you very lucky and gives you the edge over your opponents. In addition, the planets Mars, Jupiter and Uranus are all in favorable positions, which will further increase your luck.</p>
<p>This is a great time to visit casinos and betting shops, as you are likely to win big during this period. However, it is important that you gamble responsibly and do not bet more than you can afford to lose. Gambling can be addictive, so it is important to stay within your limits.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a way to make some extra money during this period, then investing in stocks and shares could be a wise move. The planets Mars, Jupiter and Uranus are all in favorable positions, which indicates that there is a good chance of making a profit.

        <h1 id="The-economic-benefits-of-gambling-legalization"><a href="#The-economic-benefits-of-gambling-legalization" class="headerlink" title="The economic benefits of gambling legalization"></a>The economic benefits of gambling legalization</h1><p>There has been a longstanding debate about the legalization of gambling. On one hand, those in favor of legalization argue that it is a personal freedom and that gambling can be a source of tax revenue for governments. On the other hand, opponents argue that gambling can be addictive and lead to financial instability. In this article, we will explore the economic benefits of gambling legalization.</p>
<p>The first benefit of legalizing gambling is that it is a source of tax revenue for governments. In the United States, state governments earn an estimated $26.5 billion in tax revenue from legalized gambling each year. This money can be used to fund important government programs, such as education and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Another benefit of legalized gambling is that it creates jobs. The casino industry employs over half a million people in the United States alone. These jobs are not only high-paying, but they also provide opportunities for career advancement. Gambling also supports many industries upstream and downstream of casinos, such as construction, food service, and advertising.</p>
<p>Legalized gambling also benefits consumers. For instance, it allows people to gamble in a safe and secure environment. It also allows people to play games of skill without fear of being arrested. And lastly, it allows people to gamble without having to travel long distances or wait in long lines.</p>
<p>Finally, legalized gambling can benefit society as a whole by reducing crime rates. This is because criminals often rely on illegal gambling activities to make money. When these activities are legalized and regulated, it takes away the profit motive for criminal activity. As a result, crime rates tend to go down once gambling is legalized.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are many economic benefits to legalizing gambling. It provides tax revenue for governments, creates jobs, benefits consumers, and reduces crime rates. While there are some risks associated with gambling, these risks can be mitigated by proper regulation</p>
<h1 id="Why-online-gambling-should-be-legalized"><a href="#Why-online-gambling-should-be-legalized" class="headerlink" title="Why online gambling should be legalized"></a>Why online gambling should be legalized</h1><p>Online gambling has been around for over two decades, and during that time it’s been the subject of much debate. Some people argue that it should be legalized while others maintain that it should remain illegal. There are pros and cons to both sides of the argument, but in the end, I believe that online gambling should be legalized.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why online gambling should be legalized. First, it’s a major source of revenue for governments. In fact, according to one study, legalizing online gambling could generate up to $6 billion in tax revenue annually. Second, it would provide jobs for thousands of people. The gaming industry is one of the fastest growing industries in the world and creating more jobs in this field would be beneficial for both the employees and the economy as a whole. Finally, online gambling is enjoyed by millions of people around the world and it’s hypocritical for governments to outlaw it while allowing other forms of gambling such as casinos and lotteries to exist.</p>
<p>There are also some arguments against legalizing online gambling. One is that it can be addictive and can lead to financial ruin for some people. However, this can also be said about many other activities such as drinking alcohol or playing poker in person. Another argument is that online gambling can be used by criminals to launder money. While this is certainly a valid concern, it can be addressed by implementing rigorous regulations governing the industry.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are good reasons both for and against legalizing online gambling. However, I believe that the benefits outweigh the risks and that online gambling should be made legal.</p>
<h1 id="The-benefits-of-legalizing-gambling"><a href="#The-benefits-of-legalizing-gambling" class="headerlink" title="The benefits of legalizing gambling"></a>The benefits of legalizing gambling</h1><p>Gambling has been around for centuries and is enjoyed by millions of people all over the world. Although it is popular, gambling is not without controversy. There are many who believe that gambling is bad for society and should be illegal. However, there are also many benefits to legalizing gambling.</p>
<p>One benefit of legalizing gambling is that it can generate tax revenue for the government. In addition to taxation, legalized gambling can also create jobs in the tourism industry. Gambling venues can also generate money for local businesses and charities.</p>
<p>Another benefit of legalizing gambling is that it can help to control crime. Gambling venues can be a place where criminals gather to commit crimes such as theft and assault. If these venues are legal and regulated, it can make it easier for law enforcement to monitor criminal activity.</p>
<p>Legalized gambling can also be beneficial for problem gamblers. By creating safe and regulated places where they can gamble, it can help them to stay away from illegal and unregulated venues which may be harmful to their health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the benefits of legalizing gambling outweigh the negatives. Gambling can generate tax revenue, create jobs, and control crime. It can also be beneficial for problem gamblers. Therefore, lawmakers should consider legalizing gambling in their jurisdictions.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-should-be-legalized-for-its-social-benefits"><a href="#Gambling-should-be-legalized-for-its-social-benefits" class="headerlink" title="Gambling should be legalized for its social benefits"></a>Gambling should be legalized for its social benefits</h1><p>Despite the fact that gambling is illegal in many parts of the world, there are still plenty of people who engage in it. According to a study by the University of Pittsburgh, nearly 80% of American adults have gambled at least once in their lives. Gambling is popular because it offers people the chance to win money or other prizes.</p>
<p>While gambling can be fun, there are also some social benefits to legalizing it. For example, legalizing gambling could help to reduce crime rates. This is because people who gamble often do so in casinos or other legal venues, which means that they are less likely to commit crimes in order to get money to gamble with.</p>
<p>Legalizing gambling could also help to generate tax revenue for governments. In addition, it could create jobs in the gaming industry. Finally, legalizing gambling could help to reduce problem gambling rates. This is because casinos and other gaming venues would be required to offer responsible gambling measures, such as limits on how much money people can spend on games of chance.</p>
<p>While there are certainly some benefits to legalizing gambling, there are also some risks associated with it. For example, legalized gambling could lead to an increase in problem gambling rates. In addition, it could lead to an increase in crime rates and social ills such as bankruptcy and family violence.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whether or not gambling should be legalized is a decision that each individual country must make based on its own needs and priorities. However, from a social perspective, there are definitely some benefits to be had from legalizing this popular pastime.</p>
<h1 id="The-economic-impact-of-legalizing-gambling"><a href="#The-economic-impact-of-legalizing-gambling" class="headerlink" title="The economic impact of legalizing gambling"></a>The economic impact of legalizing gambling</h1><p>The legalization of gambling has been a topic of debate for many years. Supporters argue that it would generate tax revenue and create jobs, while opponents argue that it would lead to increased crime and social ills. This paper will explore the economic impact of legalizing gambling.</p>
<p>Economists have long argued that gambling is a form of entertainment, and that it should be treated like any other form of entertainment, such as movies or sporting events. Gambling is currently legal in many countries, including the United States. In some states, such as Nevada and New Jersey, casino gambling is legal. The legalization of gambling would allow states to regulate and tax the industry, generating revenue for the state government.</p>
<p>Supporters argue that the legalization of gambling would create jobs in the casino industry and in related industries, such as tourism. They also argue that it would generate tax revenue for the state government. Opponents argue that gambling can lead to addiction and social ills, such as crime and bankruptcy. They also argue that casino owners would benefit from the legalization of gambling while taxpayers would bear the cost of social ills associated with gambling.</p>
<p>So what is the economic impact of legalizing gambling? A study by the National University of Singapore found that the legalization of casino gaming in Singapore would generate over $1 billion in new taxes and create nearly 24,000 jobs. In addition, it found that legalized gaming would increase tourism by 30%. Another study by Oxford Economics found that the legalization of casino gaming in Japan could generate over $10 billion in new taxes and create 160,000 jobs.</p>
<p>These studies suggest that the economic impact of legalizing gambling is positive. It would generate tax revenue for the state government and create jobs in the casino industry and related industries. However, there are also costs associated with legalizing gambling, such as increased crime and social ills. It is important to weigh these costs against the benefits when deciding whether or not to legalize gambling.</p>

        <h1 id="New-York-Woman-Wins-362-000-in-Slot-machine-Jackpot-Without-Paying-Taxes"><a href="#New-York-Woman-Wins-362-000-in-Slot-machine-Jackpot-Without-Paying-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="New York Woman Wins $362,000 in Slot machine Jackpot Without Paying Taxes"></a>New York Woman Wins $362,000 in Slot machine Jackpot Without Paying Taxes</h1><p>A woman from New York City has hit a big jackpot at a slot machine in upstate New York – and she’s planning to keep the entire amount without paying taxes.</p>
<p>The unidentified woman, who is in her early 50s, was visiting the Seneca Niagara Casino near Buffalo on a day trip when she decided to try her luck on the slots. She inserted $20 into a machine called “Quick Hit Platinum” and hit the jackpot, winning more than $362,000.</p>
<p>She was so excited that she “screamed like a banshee” according to one eyewitness, and quickly collected her winnings before leaving the casino.</p>
<p>Under New York state law, players are required to pay taxes on any slot machine winnings over $1,000. But the woman says that she doesn’t plan to report her windfall to the authorities.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to pay taxes on something I didn’t earn,” she said in an interview with local reporters. “I worked hard for this money and I’m not giving it up.”</p>
<p>The woman is reportedly consulting with lawyers to see if she can keep her winnings without paying taxes, and casino officials say they won’t be taking any action against her since she broke no rules.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time someone has managed to get around New York state’s gambling laws; in 2016, another woman declared that she wouldn’t be paying taxes on her $434,000 slot machine jackpot.</p>
<h1 id="Minnesota-Man-Hits-1-5-Million-Jackpot-at-Casino-–-Tax-Free"><a href="#Minnesota-Man-Hits-1-5-Million-Jackpot-at-Casino-–-Tax-Free" class="headerlink" title="Minnesota Man Hits $1.5 Million Jackpot at Casino – Tax-Free!"></a>Minnesota Man Hits $1.5 Million Jackpot at Casino – Tax-Free!</h1><p>Minnesota resident Richard Wahl hit the $1.5 million jackpot at a casino – but won’t have to pay a penny in taxes on his winnings!</p>
<p>Wahl, 47, who works as a production manager at a manufacturing plant, said he had been playing the $5 Mega-Millions slot machine for about two hours when the winning combination of cherries, plums, oranges and lemons popped up on the screen.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t believe it,” Wahl said. “I thought I was dreaming.”</p>
<p>Wahl walked away with a cool $1,522,000 after taxes. While some might be tempted to go on a wild spending spree with that kind of money, Wahl says he has other plans.</p>
<p>“I’m going to pay off my house and my daughter’s college tuition, and then save the rest for retirement,” Wahl said.</p>
<p>And unlike many winners who end up blowing their fortune within a few years, Wahl says he doesn’t plan on gambling any of it away.</p>
<p>“I’ve been blessed with this money and I want to make sure it lasts me the rest of my life.”</p>
<h1 id="Landmark-Gambling-Ruling-Means-Online-Winners-Won’t-Owe-Any-Tax"><a href="#Landmark-Gambling-Ruling-Means-Online-Winners-Won’t-Owe-Any-Tax" class="headerlink" title="Landmark Gambling Ruling Means Online Winners Won’t Owe Any Tax"></a>Landmark Gambling Ruling Means Online Winners Won’t Owe Any Tax</h1><p>In a landmark ruling, the U.S. Tax Court has determined that winners of online gambling activities don’t have to report their winnings as taxable income.</p>
<p>The court case revolved around whether Joseph Castleman, who had won over $150,000 from online poker games, should have paid taxes on his winnings. The IRS argued that Castleman should be taxed on his winnings as they constituted “ordinary income”, while Castleman’s lawyers countered that the money was a form of “prize winnings” and therefore not subject to taxation.</p>
<p>The Tax Court sided with Castleman, ruling that online gambling winnings are not taxable as ordinary income. While this ruling only applies to individuals in the U.S., it could set a precedent for how other countries treat online gambling winnings tax-wise.</p>
<p>This ruling is good news for online gamblers, as it removes one more hurdle in the way of being able to keep your winnings tax-free. It also underscores the importance of reporting your gambling activities to the IRS, so that you can be sure you are taking all the necessary steps to minimize your tax liability.</p>
<h1 id="British-Player-Wins-Record-£13-2m-Jackpot-Without-Paying-a-Penny-in-Tax"><a href="#British-Player-Wins-Record-£13-2m-Jackpot-Without-Paying-a-Penny-in-Tax" class="headerlink" title="British Player Wins Record £13.2m Jackpot Without Paying a Penny in Tax"></a>British Player Wins Record £13.2m Jackpot Without Paying a Penny in Tax</h1><p>British player wins record £13.2m jackpot without paying a penny in tax</p>
<p>When John, a British national, won an incredible £13.2 million jackpot playing online slots at his favorite casino, he was over the moon. But what he didn’t realize at the time was that he would never have to pay a penny in tax on his winnings!</p>
<p>Thanks to recent changes in UK gambling law, John was able to scoop the biggest ever online slots payout without having to worry about giving any of it to the taxman. This is a major coup for British players, who can now enjoy all the benefits of big jackpot wins without sacrificing a large chunk of their winnings to the government.</p>
<p>So how does this new law work? Previously, all UK casino winnings were subject to a 15% taxation rate. However, since April 2019, any winnings below £1,000 are now exempt from taxation. This change means that players can keep more of their hard-earned cash when they hit the big time at their favorite casino game.</p>
<p>This is great news for British players, who have long enjoyed some of the best online casino experiences in the world. With top-quality games and massive jackpots on offer, UK players can now enjoy even bigger wins without having to give anything up to the taxman. So why not head over to your favorite online casino and see if you can be next in line for a giant pay day?</p>
<h1 id="Could-You-Succeed-Gambling-and-Not-Pay-Tax"><a href="#Could-You-Succeed-Gambling-and-Not-Pay-Tax" class="headerlink" title="Could You Succeed Gambling and Not Pay Tax?"></a>Could You Succeed Gambling and Not Pay Tax?</h1><p>The UK gambling industry is currently worth an estimated £13.5 billion a year, and with Brexit on the horizon, there has never been a better time to be involved in the industry. But could you succeed in the industry without paying tax?</p>
<p>It is actually possible to succeed in the gambling industry without paying tax, but it’s not easy. The key is to set up your business in an offshore jurisdiction and to keep your profits out of the reach of HMRC.</p>
<p>There are a number of offshore jurisdictions that are perfect for gambling businesses, including Gibraltar and Malta. These jurisdictions have favourable tax regimes and they offer a high level of legal security. They also have well-developed gaming industries, which means you’ll have plenty of competition if you decide to set up shop there.</p>
<p>Another option is to set up a company in Panama. Panama offers complete secrecy for companies and its tax rates are very favourable. However, note that Panama is no longer considered a “tax haven” by the OECD, so its status may change in the future.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid paying tax altogether, you can always set up a company in Cyprus. Cyprus is well known for its generous tax incentives and its lax corporate governance laws. The downside is that Cyprus is currently under pressure from the European Union to tighten up its rules, so this may not be a viable option for much longer.</p>
<p>So, is it possible to succeed in the gambling industry without paying tax? The answer is yes, but it’s not easy. If you want to be sure that you won’t have to pay any taxes, you should consider setting up your business in an offshore jurisdiction like Gibraltar or Malta.</p>

        <h1 id="When-Would-Tulalip-Casino-Open-in-Ohio"><a href="#When-Would-Tulalip-Casino-Open-in-Ohio" class="headerlink" title="When Would Tulalip Casino Open in Ohio?"></a>When Would Tulalip Casino Open in Ohio?</h1><p>The opening of the Tulalip Casino in Ohio is scheduled for February 2019. This new casino will be located in the Cleveland suburb of Eastlake and it will offer gaming, dining, and entertainment options.</p>
<p>The casino is being developed by the Quapaw Tribe of Oklahoma, which already operates casinos in Illinois, Arkansas, and Mississippi. The tribe has announced that it plans to invest $250 million in the Eastlake project.</p>
<p>The new casino is expected to create 1,000 jobs. It will have a gaming floor with 2,500 slot machines and 75 table games. There will also be a 12-story hotel with 250 rooms, as well as a variety of restaurants and bars.</p>
<p>The tribe has stated that the casino will be “the premiere gaming and entertainment destination in Northeast Ohio.” It is anticipated that the casino will draw visitors from as far away as Pittsburgh and Detroit.</p>
<p>Construction on the Tulalip Casino began in May 2018. The project is expected to be completed in February 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Tribe-Awaits-Federal-Word-on-Casino-Plans"><a href="#Tribe-Awaits-Federal-Word-on-Casino-Plans" class="headerlink" title="Tribe Awaits Federal Word on Casino Plans"></a>Tribe Awaits Federal Word on Casino Plans</h1><p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Leaders of the Mescalero Apache Tribe are waiting for a federal decision on whether they can go ahead with plans for a high-stakes casino.</p>
<p>The tribe has been trying to build the casino near Ruidoso for years, but the project has been embroiled in lawsuits and regulatory hurdles.</p>
<p>Now, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is reviewing a final environmental impact statement on the casino proposal. The document was released last month after nearly a decade of study.</p>
<p>Zinke is expected to decide by the end of the year whether the casino can be built.</p>
<p>Mescalero Apache Chairman Harold Lujan said Wednesday that his tribe is ready to proceed with the casino as soon as federal officials give them the green light.</p>
<h1 id="Ohio-Casino-Location-Decision-Expected-Soon"><a href="#Ohio-Casino-Location-Decision-Expected-Soon" class="headerlink" title="Ohio Casino Location Decision Expected Soon"></a>Ohio Casino Location Decision Expected Soon</h1><p>The question of where to locate Ohio’s first casino has been under discussion for years, but a decision is finally expected in the near future. The four locations being considered are Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Toledo.</p>
<p>Each of the locations has its pros and cons. Columbus is the largest city in Ohio, but also has the most competition from other casinos in the state. Cleveland is close to Pittsburgh, which could draw business away from the casino. Cincinnati is in the middle of the state and has good transportation options. Toledo is close to Detroit, which could benefit the casino financially.</p>
<p>No matter where it is located, the casino is likely to be a major boon to the local economy. It is expected to create thousands of jobs and bring millions of dollars in revenue to the state.</p>
<h1 id="Decision-on-Tulalip-Casino-in-Ohio-Could-Come-This-Month"><a href="#Decision-on-Tulalip-Casino-in-Ohio-Could-Come-This-Month" class="headerlink" title="Decision on Tulalip Casino in Ohio Could Come This Month"></a>Decision on Tulalip Casino in Ohio Could Come This Month</h1><p>The fate of the proposed Tulalip Casino in Ohio could be decided as soon as this month, as the state’s gaming commission is expected to rule on the matter. The $600 million project, which would be located in Cleveland, has already received approval from the city’s planning commission, but it still needs the green light from the state gaming commission in order to move forward.</p>
<p>According to backers of the project, the casino would create up to 2,500 jobs and generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for the state. However, opponents argue that the casino would cannibalize business from other casinos in the area and could have a negative impact on the local community.</p>
<p>The gaming commission is expected to announce its decision on the matter later this month.</p>
<h1 id="Federal-Government-May-Approve-Tulalip-Casino-in-Ohio"><a href="#Federal-Government-May-Approve-Tulalip-Casino-in-Ohio" class="headerlink" title="Federal Government May Approve Tulalip Casino in Ohio"></a>Federal Government May Approve Tulalip Casino in Ohio</h1><p>The Federal Government is considering approving the Tulalip Casino in Ohio, after the state legalized casinos in November.</p>
<p>The casino, proposed by the Tulalip Tribe of Washington, would be located in Cincinnati and would include a hotel and other amenities. The tribe has already invested $10 million in the project.</p>
<p>If approved, the casino would create 1,000 jobs and generate $252 million in annual revenue. It would also help to revitalize the struggling area around it.</p>
<p>Casinos have been shown to be a major source of revenue for tribes, generating more than $27 billion per year. They also create jobs and promote tourism.</p>
<p>The Tulalip Casino proposal is just one of many that are being considered for approval by the Federal Government.</p>
