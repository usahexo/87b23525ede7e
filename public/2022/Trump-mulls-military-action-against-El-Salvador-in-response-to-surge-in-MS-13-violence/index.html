<p>According to Department of Homeland Security officials, the number of MS-13 members and affiliates in the United States has surged in recent years. The gang is believed to be responsible for a range of violent crimes, including murder, rape, and extortion.</p>
<p>Trump has vowed to crack down on the gang and has previously threatened to send troops to El Salvador to deal with the problem. Now it appears that he is actually considering taking such action.</p>
<p>The president has come under criticism for his hardline stance on immigration and his focus on the MS-13 gang. Critics argue that Trump is using the gang as a scapegoat for the country’s broader immigration problems.</p>
<p>But Trump insists that he is only trying to keep American citizens safe from harm. “We’re going to get rid of them very quickly,” he said of MS-13 earlier this year. “They are animals.”</p>
<h1 id="Trump-authorizes-airstrikes-against-El-Salvador-in-response-to-MS-13-violence"><a href="#Trump-authorizes-airstrikes-against-El-Salvador-in-response-to-MS-13-violence" class="headerlink" title="Trump authorizes airstrikes against El Salvador in response to MS-13 violence"></a>Trump authorizes airstrikes against El Salvador in response to MS-13 violence</h1><p>President Trump has authorized airstrikes against El Salvador in response to the violence perpetrated by the MS-13 gang. In a statement released by the White House, Trump said:</p>
<p>“The MS-13 gang has been responsible for tremendous violence in El Salvador, and we are going to do everything in our power to stop them. I have authorized airstrikes against their bases and locations, and we will continue to target these thugs until they are brought to justice.”</p>
<p>The MS-13 gang is a notorious international criminal organization that has its roots in El Salvador. The group is known for its brutal crimes, including murder, rape, and extortion. In recent years, the MS-13 has been active in the United States, where it has been blamed for a number of murders and other violent crimes.</p>
<p>Trump’s announcement has been met with mixed reactions. Some people are praising the President for taking action against the MS-13, while others are criticizing him for launching airstrikes against a small country like El Salvador. Whatever one’s opinion may be, it is clear that Trump is serious about stopping the MS-13 and is willing to take whatever action is necessary.</p>
<h1 id="Trump-sends-troops-to-El-Salvador-to-combat-MS-13"><a href="#Trump-sends-troops-to-El-Salvador-to-combat-MS-13" class="headerlink" title="Trump sends troops to El Salvador to combat MS-13"></a>Trump sends troops to El Salvador to combat MS-13</h1><p>In an effort to combat the MS-13 gang, President Trump has sent troops to El Salvador.</p>
<p>The MS-13 gang is a notorious group that originated in Los Angeles in the 1980s. They are known for their extremely violent behavior, including murder, rape, and robbery.</p>
<p>Trump has long been concerned about the spread of MS-13 and has taken a hard-line stance against the group. In announcing the deployment of troops to El Salvador, he said, “We’re going to be sending troops down and we’re going to be working militarily with El Salvador and we’re going to be doing a lot of good.”</p>
<p>The deployment of troops will likely help to improve security in El Salvador and could ultimately lead to the dismantling of the MS-13 gang. This would be a major victory for Trump and would further his goal of making America safe again.</p>
<h1 id="El-Salvador-on-the-brink-of-civil-war-as-Trump-escalates-tensions-with-MS-13"><a href="#El-Salvador-on-the-brink-of-civil-war-as-Trump-escalates-tensions-with-MS-13" class="headerlink" title="El Salvador on the brink of civil war as Trump escalates tensions with MS-13"></a>El Salvador on the brink of civil war as Trump escalates tensions with MS-13</h1><p>El Salvador is on the brink of civil war as President Trump escalates tensions with the MS-13 gang. In a series of tweets over the past few days, Trump has threatened to send in the US military to deal with the gang, which he claims is responsible for a wave of violence in El Salvador.</p>
<p>The MS-13 gang was formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s by refugees from El Salvador who had fled the country’s civil war. The gang has since spread to other parts of the US, as well as Central America and Mexico. The Trump administration has singled out MS-13 as a major source of crime and violence, and has pledged to crack down on it.</p>
<p>El Salvador’s president, Salvador Sánchez Cerén, has condemned Trump’s threats and accused him of trying to create a panic in order to justify military action in El Salvador. The government of El Salvador has also warned that any US military intervention could lead to civil war.</p>
<p>Tensions between the MS-13 gang and the government of El Salvador have been rising for several years. In 2015, Sánchez Cerén declared a state of emergency in response to an increase in violence attributed to the gang. Since then, there have been several hundred murders attributed to MS-13.</p>
<p>The roots of the conflict lie in poverty and social inequality. El Salvador is one of the most unequal countries in Latin America, with a high level of poverty and unemployment. The MS-13 gang has its roots in this unequal society, recruiting young people who have no prospects for a better future.</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s efforts to crackdown on MS-13 will do nothing to address these underlying problems. In fact, they could well make things worse by fuelling further resentment and extremism. The only solution is political not military: it is essential that El Salvador addresses the root causes of inequality and social exclusion if it is to achieve peace and stability</p>
<h1 id="Could-Trump’s-policies-lead-to-a-full-blown-war-in-El-Salvador"><a href="#Could-Trump’s-policies-lead-to-a-full-blown-war-in-El-Salvador" class="headerlink" title="Could Trump’s policies lead to a full-blown war in El Salvador?"></a>Could Trump’s policies lead to a full-blown war in El Salvador?</h1><p>﻿In the past year, the Trump administration has implemented a number of controversial policies with regards to El Salvador. These policies have led to heightened tensions between the US and El Salvador, and could potentially lead to a full-blown war in El Salvador.</p>
<p>In March 2018, the Trump administration announced that it was ending temporary protected status (TPS) for 200,000 Salvadorans living in the US. This decision left thousands of Salvadorans with little choice but to return to a country that is rife with violence and poverty.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has also threatened to cut off aid to El Salvador if it fails to take action against MS-13, a violent gang that operates in both El Salvador and the US. In June 2018, Trump tweeted that “the United States is working very closely with the Government of El Salvador to stop the MS-13 problem.”</p>
<p>These policies have created a great deal of tension between the US and El Salvador. In July 2018, Salvadoran President Salvador Sanchez Ceren accused the US of trying to destabilize his country. “It’s clear that they want something else in addition to TPS,” he said. “They want us to submit to their policy demands.”</p>
<p>And tensions could increase even further in 2019, as US troops are scheduled to begin deploying to El Salvador as part of a new anti-gang initiative.</p>
<p>So why is the Trump administration implementing these controversial policies towards El Salvador? It’s possible that they are trying to use El Salvador as a bargaining chip in negotiations with Mexico over immigration reform. Or it’s possible that they simply don’t understand the complexities of the situation in El Salvador, and are inadvertently exacerbating the problems there.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, it’s clear that these policies are having a negative impact on relations between the US and El Salvador. And if things don’t change soon, it’s possible that we could see a full-blown war break out in El Salvador.</p>
