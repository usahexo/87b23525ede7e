<p>However, there are some things that increase a person’s risk of developing a gambling addiction. These include:</p>
<p>• Having a family history of addiction<br> • Experiencing stressful life events • Having poor mental health • Having low self-esteem • Feeling isolated or lonely • Having easy access to gambling venues</p>
<p>How Does Gambling Addiction Impact People’s Lives?</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have a significant impact on people’s lives. It can lead to financial problems, ruined relationships, and even criminal activity. Here are some of the most common ways that gambling addiction impacts people’s lives:</p>

This may include borrowing money from friends and family members, going into debt, or even filing for bankruptcy. • Relationship problems – Gambling can strain relationships with friends and family members.
